# Unreal Rogue Like
Custom Rogue Like made in Unreal through Tom Looman's Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine course.

## Aim
1) To refamiliarise myself with C++ both as a whole and within the context of Unreal Engine.
2) To understand how best to leverage the power of C++ for designing and developing tools to use in Unreal Engine.

I've done bits and bobs of programming during my PhD but it has mostly been either analysing data in Python or developing games in game jams and a narrative game in Unity with C#. It's been great to go back to the language I first learnt to program in and also to learn more about Unreal.

## Additional information
Created in unreal Engine 4.27.1
